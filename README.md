Developed by Gabriel Ramsay, Slav Photography is a clean, professional web platform designed for clients to browse a portfolio, explore service packages, and seamlessly book photography sessions.

Project Overview:

This project serves as a digital storefront for a professional photographer. It balances a minimalist aesthetic with functional utility, focusing on a streamlined contact interface and a visual-first portfolio experience.

Functionality:

Dynamic Portfolio: A curated look at past photography work.

Service Packages: Detailed breakdown of session types (Solo, Couple, Wedding).

Lead Generation Form: A customized contact form with hover-active animations and validation.

Sticky Navigation: Easy site-wide access regardless of page scroll depth.

Technologies Used:
HTML: Semantic structure for accessibility and SEO.

CSS: Custom styling featuring Flexbox, CSS Gradients, and Pseudo-element animations.

Bootstrap: Utilized for core grid stability and responsive components.

JavaScript: Used for form handling and state management. 

Future Enhancements:

Mobile Responsiveness: Implement CSS Media Queries to optimize the viewing experience for phones and tabblets. 

Integrated Payment Gateway: Develop a checkout flow using various APIs to allow clients to pay for packages directly upon booking. *

Enhance Visuals: Implement advanced scroll animations (AOS library as an example) and lazy loading for high-resolution images to improve performance.

Client Gallery Access: Create a password protected area where clients can view and download their specific session photos. (Just an idea)
