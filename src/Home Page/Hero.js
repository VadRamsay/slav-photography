                <p>
                    During my freshman year of college, a simple photography project in a fine arts class
                    sparked an exciting new passion and marked the beginning of a journey. Now, almost 10 years later,
                    I get to share this passion with the world. Photography has a way of helping a person communicate
                    their truest perspective. My desire is to help my clients capture theirs!<br></br>
